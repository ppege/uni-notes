# Inference rules
In logical inference, we create rules that let us tie a set of logical statements that are assumed to be true (**premises**) to a singular **conclusion** that must also be true under the premises. The premises together with the conclusion are referred to as an **argument**.

> \begin{aligned}
> &p\rightarrow q \\
> &p& \\
> &––––– \\
> \therefore&q

> [!info] **Example**: Modus Tollens
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> &p\rightarrow q \\
> &\neg q& \\
> &––––– \\
> \therefore&\neg p
> \end{aligned}
