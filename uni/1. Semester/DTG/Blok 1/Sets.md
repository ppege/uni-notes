# Sets
A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members. We write $e\in S$ if the element $e$ is in the set $S$. A set is usually denoted by listing its elements: 
$$
B=\set{0, 1}
$$
The empty set is the set that contains no elements: 
$$
\emptyset=\set{}
$$
A set can contain other sets: 
$$
S=\set{\set{},\set{0},\set{1},\set{0,1}}
$$
A set containing a single element is often referred to as a singleton. For example, $\{a\}$ is a singleton of $a$.
### Important sets

## Set builder notation
Not all sets can be described by listing the elements. The set builder notation can be used to describe which elements belong to the set in this case. Let $D$ be a domain of discourse and $P$ be a propositional function, then 
$$
S=\{e\in D|Q(e)\}
$$
is the set of all elements in $D$ for which $Q(e)$ is true.
