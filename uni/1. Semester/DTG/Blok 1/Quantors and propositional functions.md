## Propositional functions
A propositional function is an expression, containing one of more variables, which becomes a proposition when each of the variables is replaced by some one of its values from a discourse domain (universe) of individuals.
## Quantors
### Universal quantor
The universal quantification of a propositional function $P(x)$ is the proposition
> $P(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ in the domain.

We denote this by $\forall x P(x)$. This proposition is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true for all possible values of $x$. It is false as soon as in the domain one counterexample $x$ exists for which $P(x)$ is false.
### Existential quantor
The existential quantification of a propositional function $P(x)$ is the proposition
> There exists an element in $x$ in the domain such that $P(x)$ is true.

We denote this by $\exists x P(x)$. This proposition is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true for at least one possible value of $x$. It is false if $P(x)$ is false for all $x$ in the domain. $\exists !x P(x)$ means there exists *exactly* one $x$ where $P(x)$ is true.
