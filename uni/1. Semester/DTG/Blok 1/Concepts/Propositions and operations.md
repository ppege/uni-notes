> The course is split into 4 blocks, each ending with a *workshop* in which you and your group spend 6 hours working on a massive sheet about the contents of the block. During the exam you will present one of the four workshops, so be sure to write things down!

**Propositions** are declarative sentences that can be true or false. These are typically denoted with small letters, usually $p$, $q$, and $r$.

## Operations
**Negation** is the "not" operator, using the symbol $\neg$. $\neg p$ is "not $p$", and this flips the truth value of the proposition $p$.
**Conjunction** is the "and" operator, which connects two propositions with the symbol $\wedge$. The conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is subsequently $p\wedge q$. $p\wedge q$ is true if, and only if, both $p$ and $q$ have a truth value of $T$, ie $v(p)=T\wedge v(q)=T$.
**Disjunction** is the "or" operator, connecting two propositions with the symbol $\vee$. The conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is $p\vee q$, and is true if $p$ or $q$ have a truth value of $T$, ie $v(p)=T\vee v(q)=T$.
**Implication** is the "if ... then" operator, connecting two propositions with the symbol $\rightarrow$. The implication $p\rightarrow q$ is true if $p$ "implicates" $q$. This is best understood by the truth tables.
**Bi-implication** is the "if and only if" operator, connecting two propositions with the symbol $\leftrightarrow$. The bi-implication $p\leftrightarrow q$ is true if the truth values of $p$ and $q$ are identical, ie $v(p)=v(q)$.
